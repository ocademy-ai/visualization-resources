## Streamlit vs. Shiny vs. Jupyter

- https://www.datarevenue.com/en-blog/data-dashboarding-streamlit-vs-dash-vs-shiny-vs-voila

Streamlit is a dashboard tool based on Python, while Shiny uses R. Both tools focus on turning data analysis scripts into full, interactive web applications. 

Streamlit is a full data dashboarding solution, while Jupyter Notebooks are primarily useful to engineers who want to develop software and visualizations. Engineers use Streamlit to build dashboards for non-technical users, and they use Jupyter Notebooks to develop code and share it with other engineers.




## R Shiny

### https://statistics.calpoly.edu/shiny

This one is very comprehensive.

What's included:
- Regression	
- Inference	
- Probability and Randomness
- Distribution Theory and Estimation

## Streamlit 

There seems not to be a Hub for streamlit apps on the topic of statistics & machine learning.

Basically, tensorflow.js is rarely used for machine learning visualization purpose, especially for pedagogical goal.
